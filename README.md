# AgentCommunication
Testing possibility of realization of user-agent talk in console (python realization)
And more todos in the future(within some thoughts on how to let this api coop with the google places api):
# Input analysis: 
let the ai analyze the user-provided keyword and search results generated by Google Places API
# Keyword refinement:
Let the ai suggest or generate refined keywords based on the initial results
# result filtering:
It have to be able to eliminate unnecessary results
# iterative search:
It will be able to perform iterative searches by modifying the keyword and analyzing the new results


better be realized by only apis (better be free) instead of training/deploying model locally/remotely. Bro don't wanna dive too deap at this point

But first will test possibility of this single api only without interference from/within google places api
