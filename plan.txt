*@Bruh@*recording the model in use, which might be different for each branch*@Bruh@*


*****************This branch implement the user-agent talk into terminala and record the talk into a txt file.

All the info regarding of the model/api usage is literally same to the DSV3.1 branch

Ideas of the interactive program: using simple while loop, enter q to terminate.

First option: Do u wanna generate dialog history? (y/n)

Second option: Please setting system role: ... (excepting user input of a string)
    The input may contain \n! Somehow need to make something like shift+enter thing.
    e.g. system role: "You are an assistant that follows user-defined constraints strictly."

Third option: feed the prompt to terminal, then display result fetched from api response..
    * Now, the user-defined constraint should stay inside the prompt

And I suppose it runing in a loop, in the same session...
When third option's user input provided as a "q" or "Q" or "quit", end as if 'ctrl-c'
